url gen notes

example: http://reports.idttechnology.com/traffic/tgdsum.psp?sdt=2015-08-20_10&edt=2015-08-20_11&otg=LEVEL3LAC

make sure to feed it GMT time, so use get_timeframe(). otherwise interprets EST time as GMT and you view the wrong results.

tried this trunk: NPPOTELEGITX_Y

direction was outbound. therefore in the url, do 'dtg=NPPOTELEGITX_Y'

if direction == 'O'
	use dtg=
elif direction == 'I'
	use otg=
